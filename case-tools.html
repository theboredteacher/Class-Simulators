        'Class Diagrams represent the static structure of a system, showing classes, attributes, operations, and relationships between classes.',
        'Sequence Diagrams illustrate the dynamic behavior of objects, focusing on the sequence of messages exchanged between them over time.',
        'Use Case Diagrams capture the functional requirements of a system, depicting actors, use cases, and their relationships.',

        'The generated code is based on predefined templates and transformation rules, ensuring consistency and reducing manual coding efforts.',
